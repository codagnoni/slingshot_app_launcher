       disable the hotspot
    6: Packed the schemas (forgotten in version 5)
    7: Better use of standard CSS
       Tries to keep the size of the meny as steady as possible, by
       tracking the maximum size used
    8: Reduces the icon matrix when the screen is small (based on code
       from kirby33)

       or text)
